# WABot-NutriAI - WhatsApp Nutrition Assistant & AI Chatbot

WABot-NutriAI is an intelligent WhatsApp chatbot that helps users with personalized nutrition recommendations and AI-powered health chat.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**: The food recommendation feature requires a separate Machine Learning model which is not included in this repository. You need to develop or provide your own ML model API to enable this feature.

## Key Features

- üçΩÔ∏è **Personalized Meal Recommendations**: Based on user profile (age, weight, height, activity, goals)
- üí¨ **Nutrition AI Chat**: Interactive chat with AI about health, nutrition, diet, and exercise
- üìä **Nutrition Calculations**: Calculates BMI, BMR, and daily calorie needs
- üîê **Secure & Private**: All data is stored temporarily and not persisted

## How It Works

1. Send message `!halo` to start
2. Choose between:
   - `!recomend` to get food recommendations based on your profile
   - `!chat` to chat with AI about nutrition and health

### Recommendation Mode
The bot will ask several questions to build your nutrition profile:
- Gender
- Weight (kg)
- Height (cm)
- Age (years)
- Activity level (1-5)
- Goal (weight loss, muscle gain, health maintenance)

### AI Chat Mode
Ask anything about nutrition and health. The bot will automatically exit chat mode after 3 minutes of inactivity.
